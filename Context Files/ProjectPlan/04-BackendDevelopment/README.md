# Backend Development

## Overview

This directory contains detailed plans and documentation for implementing the OverWatch Mission Control backend components. The backend is built on Python and ROS (Robot Operating System), providing microservices for hardware integration, data processing, and API access.

## Component Documentation

### ROS Integration

The ROS integration documentation details how to integrate Robot Operating System with OverWatch:

- **[ros-coordinates.md](./ros-integration/ros-coordinates.md)**: Explains ROS coordinate systems and their integration with the OverWatch application, including transformations between different coordinate frames and handling sensor-specific references.

## Implementation Sequence

For backend implementation, follow this recommended sequence:

1. Set up the Python and ROS development environment
2. Implement the ROS Bridge service for WebSocket communication
3. Develop core backend microservices following the architecture document
4. Implement ROS coordinate transformations according to ros-coordinates.md
5. Create hardware integration services for drones and sensors
6. Develop the data processing and storage services
7. Implement the API Gateway for non-real-time data access
8. Add advanced processing capabilities (SLAM, computer vision)
9. Optimize for performance and reliability

See the main [Implementation Guide](../01-InitialSetup/01-Implementation-Guide.md) for the complete development sequence that includes frontend integration.

## Backend Microservices

The backend consists of several key microservices:

1. **ROS Bridge Service**: Central communication hub connecting the frontend with the ROS ecosystem
2. **Sensor Services**: Interfaces with physical hardware sensors (Phase One, Ouster, Sony)
3. **Mission Services**: Handles mission planning, execution, and monitoring
4. **Data Processing Services**: Processes sensor data, computer vision, and 3D reconstruction
5. **API Gateway**: Provides REST/GraphQL endpoints for non-real-time data

For detailed implementation of these services, refer to the [Backend Architecture](../02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md) document.

## Hardware Integration

The backend is responsible for interfacing with various hardware components:

- **Flight Controllers**: Communication via MAVLink/MAVROS
- **Cameras**: Integration with various camera SDKs
- **LiDAR**: Processing point cloud data
- **GPS/RTK**: Handling precise positioning data

Each hardware integration follows standardized patterns documented in the backend architecture.

## Purpose

The Backend Development phase focuses on implementing the server-side components of the application, including API services, database integration, ROS bridge, and supporting microservices.
