# ROS Bridge README

## Overview

This directory contains documentation specific to the implementation of the ROS Bridge service.

The ROS Bridge service acts as the central communication hub connecting the web-based frontend application with the backend ROS ecosystem via WebSockets. It translates between web protocols and ROS messages/services.

## Key Responsibilities

- Run `rosbridge_server` to provide a WebSocket interface to ROS.
- Handle WebSocket connections from the frontend.
- Authenticate and authorize client connections.
- Manage ROS topic subscriptions and publications based on client requests.
- Facilitate ROS service calls initiated by the frontend.
- Translate messages between JSON (frontend) and ROS message types.

## Technology

- `rosbridge_suite` (ROS package)
- Python (for potential custom wrappers or extensions)

## Core Documentation

- **[Backend Architecture](../../02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md)**: Provides the high-level design and context for the ROS Bridge service.
- **[StepByStepGuide.md](./StepByStepGuide.md)**: Outlines the specific implementation tasks for this component.
- **[ROS Integration ../ros-integration/](./../ros-integration/)**: Contains details on ROS coordinate systems and communication patterns.

## Next Steps

Follow the tasks outlined in the [StepByStepGuide.md](./StepByStepGuide.md) to configure and implement the ROS Bridge service.
