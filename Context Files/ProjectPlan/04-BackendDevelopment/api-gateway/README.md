# API Gateway README

## Overview

This directory contains documentation specific to the implementation of the Backend API Gateway service.

The API Gateway serves as the primary entry point for non-real-time frontend requests, handling authentication, request routing to appropriate microservices, and potentially response aggregation.

## Key Responsibilities

- Provide REST/GraphQL endpoints for frontend interaction.
- Authenticate incoming requests.
- Route requests to downstream microservices.
- Validate incoming request data.
- Aggregate responses from multiple services if needed.
- Generate API documentation automatically (Swagger/ReDoc).

## Technology

- FastAPI (Python)

## Core Documentation

- **[Backend Architecture](../../02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md)**: Provides the high-level design and context for the API Gateway.
- **[StepByStepGuide.md](./StepByStepGuide.md)**: Outlines the specific implementation tasks for this component.

## Next Steps

Follow the tasks outlined in the [StepByStepGuide.md](./StepByStepGuide.md) to implement the API Gateway.
