# Frontend Architecture Details README

## Overview

This directory is intended to hold detailed artifacts, diagrams, and architectural decision records (ADRs) specifically related to the **frontend architecture** defined in the main `02-CoreArchitecture/01-FrontendArchitecture.md` document.

## Potential Content

- Detailed diagrams of component interactions or state flow.
- ADRs for significant frontend technology choices or patterns (e.g., state management library details, specific UI patterns).
- Sequence diagrams illustrating complex frontend workflows (e.g., Babylon.js worker communication).
- Detailed diagrams of the Web Worker architecture.
- Component library structure and design decisions.

## Purpose

This folder provides a space for more granular frontend architectural documentation that might be too detailed for the main architecture overview document, ensuring context is preserved for specific frontend design decisions.
