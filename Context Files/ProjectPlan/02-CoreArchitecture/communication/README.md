# Communication Architecture Details README

## Overview

This directory is intended to hold detailed artifacts, diagrams, and architectural decision records (ADRs) related to the **communication patterns and protocols** used within the OverWatch system. This includes both frontend-backend communication and inter-service communication within the backend.

## Potential Content

- Sequence diagrams detailing WebSocket interactions via the ROS Bridge.
- Diagrams illustrating gRPC or other inter-service communication flows.
- ADRs related to protocol choices (e.g., WebSocket vs. REST vs. gRPC for specific use cases).
- Detailed specifications for message formats or custom protocols.
- Diagrams showing authentication flows within communication.

## Purpose

This folder allows for focused documentation on how different parts of the system communicate, complementing the main architecture documents (`01-FrontendArchitecture.md`, `02-BackendArchitecture.md`) by providing deeper insights into the interaction mechanisms.
