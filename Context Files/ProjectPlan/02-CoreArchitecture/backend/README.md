# Backend Architecture Details README

## Overview

This directory is intended to hold detailed artifacts, diagrams, and architectural decision records (ADRs) specifically related to the **backend microservices architecture** defined in the main `02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md` document.

## Potential Content

- Detailed diagrams of specific service interactions.
- ADRs for significant backend technology choices or patterns.
- Sequence diagrams illustrating complex backend workflows.
- Interface definitions between backend services (if not covered elsewhere).

## Purpose

This folder provides a space for more granular backend architectural documentation that might be too detailed for the main architecture overview document, ensuring context is preserved for specific backend design decisions.
