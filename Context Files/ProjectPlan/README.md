# OverWatch Mission Control - Project Plan

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive project plan for rebuilding the OverWatch Mission Control application. The plan outlines the approach, architecture, timeline, and detailed tasks for developing a modern, robust mission control system for drone operations with advanced visualization, real-time data processing, and hardware integration capabilities.

## Project Vision

OverWatch Mission Control serves as the central hub for a sophisticated drone operation system, integrating:

- Real-time drone telemetry and control
- 3D visualization of missions and sensor data
- Processing of data from high-end sensors (Phase One, Ouster, Sony ILX)
- Mission planning and execution management
- Integration with advanced processing systems via ROS (Robot Operating System)

## Plan Structure

The project plan is organized into logical phases, each with detailed documents:

## Implementation Guide

The most important document for beginning development is the **Implementation Guide**, which provides a step-by-step sequence for rebuilding OverWatch:

**[01-InitialSetup/01-Implementation-Guide.md](./01-InitialSetup/01-Implementation-Guide.md)**

This guide:
- Outlines the development sequence across all phases
- Provides clear references to detailed documentation
- Serves as a roadmap for both AI assistants and human developers
- Explains how components should be implemented in the correct order

## Key Documents

To get started with this project plan, we recommend reviewing these key documents in order:

1. **[00-ProjectOverview.md](./00-ProjectOverview.md)** - High-level understanding of the project
2. **[00-ProjectDependencies.md](./00-ProjectDependencies.md)** - Component dependencies and critical paths
3. **[01-InitialSetup/01-Implementation-Guide.md](./01-InitialSetup/01-Implementation-Guide.md)** - Step-by-step implementation roadmap
4. **[00-ProjectOverview/OverWatch-Overview.md](./00-ProjectOverview/OverWatch-Overview.md)** - Comprehensive system overview
5. **[01-InitialSetup/01-ProjectRequirements.md](./01-InitialSetup/01-ProjectRequirements.md)** - Functional and non-functional requirements
6. **[02-CoreArchitecture/01-FrontendArchitecture.md](./02-CoreArchitecture/01-FrontendArchitecture.md)** - Frontend architecture
7. **[02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md](./02-CoreArchitecture/02-BackendArchitecture.md)** - Backend architecture
