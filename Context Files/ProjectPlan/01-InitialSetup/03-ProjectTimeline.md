## Critical Path & Dependencies

The following represent critical path components and key dependencies:

1. **ROS Integration**: The ROS bridge and hardware integration are critical for all real-time operations and must be established early.

2. **Babylon.js Web Worker Architecture**: This foundational component affects all 3D visualization capabilities and must be completed before advanced visualization features.

3. **Coordinate System Transformations**: This core functionality enables proper positioning in 3D space and is needed for all spatial operations.

4. **Real-time Data Flow**: The end-to-end data pipeline from sensors to visualization is critical for system functionality.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Hardware SDK integration challenges | High | Medium | Early prototyping, alternative approach planning, vendor consultation |
| Performance issues with 3D visualization | High | Medium | Web Worker architecture, incremental testing, optimization sprints |
| ROS compatibility issues | High | Medium | Early proof-of-concept, version compatibility testing, fallback options |
| Integration delays | Medium | High | Regular integration testing, modular architecture, clear APIs |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict change management, prioritized backlog, MVP focus |

## Milestone Review Gates

Regular milestone reviews will be conducted at the following points:

1. **Architecture Review** (End of Phase 2)
