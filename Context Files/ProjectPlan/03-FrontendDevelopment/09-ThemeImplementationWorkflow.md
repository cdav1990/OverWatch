# OverWatch Theme Implementation Workflow

This document outlines the steps required to implement a dual-theme system (dark and light) for the OverWatch Mission Control application. The themes will support both office use (dark theme) and field operations in bright sunlight (light theme).

## Phase 1: Theme System Architecture

### Design System Setup
- [ ] Define color token system with base and semantic color variables
- [ ] Create typography scale with responsive adjustments for all device sizes
- [ ] Establish spacing and layout grid system that works across themes
- [ ] Define elevation/shadow system that works in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Design component-specific tokens that inherit from global theme values

### Theme Provider Implementation
- [ ] Set up ThemeProvider context with theme switching functionality
- [ ] Create theme storage in local storage for persistence
- [ ] Implement system preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- [ ] Build theme switching animation for smooth transitions
- [ ] Add theme toggle component with appropriate accessibility features

## Phase 2: Component Theming

### Core Component Theming
- [ ] Update Button component with theme-aware styling
- [ ] Refactor Card and Panel components for both themes
- [ ] Implement Form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes) with theme support
- [ ] Update Navigation and Menu components to support both themes
- [ ] Redesign Modal and Dialog components for theme compatibility

### Data Visualization Theming
- [ ] Create theme-aware chart and graph components
- [ ] Implement 3D visualization theme adjustments for Babylon.js scenes
- [ ] Design data table theme with appropriate contrast for both modes
- [ ] Update map visualization with theme-specific styling
- [ ] Implement theme-aware iconography system

### Specialized UI Elements
- [ ] Redesign mission control dashboard with theme support
- [ ] Update telemetry displays with theme-specific readability optimizations
- [ ] Implement theme-aware alert and notification system
- [ ] Create theme-compatible loading and progress indicators
- [ ] Design theme-specific tooltips and popovers

## Phase 3: Theme-specific Optimizations

### Sunlight Optimizations (Light Theme)
- [ ] Implement high-contrast mode for extreme sunlight conditions
- [ ] Create anti-glare display optimizations for critical UI elements
- [ ] Design outdoor-specific color adjustments for maximum readability
- [ ] Implement larger touch targets for field operations
- [ ] Add brightness adjustment controls for varying light conditions

### Dark Environment Optimizations (Dark Theme)
- [ ] Implement reduced blue light option for nighttime operations
- [ ] Create low-light optimized UI elements for command center use
- [ ] Design subtle contrast adjustments to reduce eye strain
- [ ] Implement optional luminance reduction for dark environments
- [ ] Add night vision compatibility mode with red-shifted colors

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

### Theme Testing Framework
- [ ] Create theme switch testing utilities for component tests
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing for both themes
- [ ] Design accessibility testing suite for color contrast validation
- [ ] Build theme-specific user testing scenarios
- [ ] Implement automated theme compatibility tests

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] Conduct field testing in sunlight conditions with light theme
- [ ] Test dark theme in command center environment
- [ ] Gather user feedback on theme switching and preferences
- [ ] Measure performance impact of theme implementation
- [ ] Iterate on theme design based on operator feedback

## Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Create theme implementation guidelines for new components
- [ ] Document theme token system and naming conventions
- [ ] Build theme extension documentation for future theme variants
- [ ] Create examples of correctly themed components
- [ ] Document known edge cases and solutions

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for theme selection and customization
- [ ] Document recommended theme settings for different environments
- [ ] Design onboarding experience for theme system
- [ ] Build help resources for accessibility features
- [ ] Create theme troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Design System Agent**:
   - Generate design tokens for both themes
   - Create theme switching logic
   - Design component-specific theming approach

2. **Component Implementation Agent**:
   - Update existing components with theme support
   - Ensure all components respond to theme changes
   - Validate component theming across breakpoints

3. **Specialized UI Agent**:
   - Implement mission-critical UI with theme awareness
   - Create 3D visualization theme adaptations
   - Design data visualization with theme support

4. **Testing & Optimization Agent**:
   - Create testing utilities for theme validation
   - Test all components in both themes
   - Optimize theme performance

5. **Documentation Agent**:
   - Document theme system for developers
   - Create user documentation for theme features
   - Build theme guideline resources
